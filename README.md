# On-Call Schedule
This project is a tool for creating on-call schedules for team members. It allows users to define their own rules for 
scheduling or use a predefined set of standard rules. Important factors such as absences due to holidays or 
other time off will be considered.

# Enhancements 
Future enhancements include the ability to export schedules as CSV files or integrate directly with calendar services.
